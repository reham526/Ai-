<p style="color: black">The term “Robot” was firstly used in a play by Karel Capek named “Rossum’s Universal Robots” [2] in 1921. The story of the play is about human making robots and these robots are destroying the people. As usual in the human history, the dream world of the man has led the way and then real world followed it. Especially after the Industrial Revolution in the start of 19th century, with complex mechanics and electrics the robotics science started to appear and develop. In the early stages of robots, they are built to complete tasks in producing without any human assistance. M. Turing asked “Can machines think?” [6] in his paper in 1950. It is a common question if the machines can have intelligence, even if they would become as complex as our body. Thus, AI community is in doubt between recreating the human intelligence on the machine, and creating intelligence that is unique to the machine. There are many events in robotics history, but a summarized list of some main events can be seen at the table</p>
