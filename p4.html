But first, let’s see some amazing summarized examples!

Through AI and machine learning, the most profitable audiences can be found for any ad. This means that intelligent algorithms are able to learn, detect, and predict which types of users are more likely to become clients at a lower cost per acquisition.

  <h1 style="font-size: 20px;color: white"> We’ve already seen how AI is revolutionizing marketing… but sales are not far behind.

What’s the best price for a product or service? With automatic machine learning, price trends can be correlated with sales trends through an algorithm that aligns other factors, such as category management and inventory levels. The establishment of dynamic prices driven by AI will mean higher profit margins for companies.

      AI is also becoming a retailer’s best friend since there are already AI platforms that monitor the habits of sales representatives, giving them recommendations to improve their performance.

      These intelligent CRMs allow them to have a better overview of all the elements involved in the sales process and discover sales opportunities in an unprecedented way.
