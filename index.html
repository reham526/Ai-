Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer sciences that emphasizes the development of intelligence machines, thinking and working <br>like humans. For example, speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning.<br>
    Today, Artificial Intelligence is a very popular subject that is widely discussed in the technology and business circles. Many experts and industry<br> analysts argue that AI or machine learning is the future – but if we look around, we are convinced that it’s not the future – it is the present.<br>

With the advancement in technology, we are already connected to AI in one way or the other – whether it is Siri, Watson or Alexa. Yes, the<br> technology is in its initial phase and more and more companies are investing resources in machine learning, indicating a robust growth in AI products and apps in the near future.<br>
